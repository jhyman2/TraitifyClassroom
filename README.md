TraitifyClassroom uses Traitify's personality test to help teachers cater a classroom curriculum to their students' personalities.

It will be great for assigning roles for students throughout the entire school year.

This project was developed at the Baltimore Hackathon by Patrick Roderick, Jonathan Soffar, and Jamison Hyman.

To run locally:
- Install django, python, and pip
- run python manage.py runserver
